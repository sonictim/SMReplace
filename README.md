##### USE AT YOUR OWN RISK I OFFER NO SUPPORT OF ANY KIND
##### THIS LITERALLY CHANGES RECORDS IN YOUR DATABASE, SO I ADVISE YOU NEVER USE IT UNLESS YOU ARE VERY CERTAIN

### USAGE: 
   `SMReplace "search text" "replacement text" <database> [options]`

   Download the binary or compile it.  I recommend moving it to your Soundminer Databases folder.
   If you don't know where your Soundminer Databases folder is, you probalby should not use this program

A simple text search and replace for your Soundminer SQLite database.  It is intended to help you update filepaths after you move files around so you don't have to ue live relink, but you can also use the `-c` flag to specify a different column if you find that useful.
