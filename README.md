 CLI tool to find and replace file paths in Soundminer SQLITE databases.

### THIS LITERALLY CHANGES RECORDS IN YOUR DATABASE, SO I ADVISE YOU NEVER USE IT UNLESS YOU ARE VERY CERTAIN

Usage: 
    `SMReplace <search text> <replacement text> database`

A simple text search and replace for your Soundminer SQLite database.  It is intended to help you update filepaths after you move files around so you don't have to ue live relink, but you can also use the `-c` flag to specify a different column if you find that useful.
